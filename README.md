Carbon Neutrality Through Forestification
This application helps estimate the carbon sequestration potential of forest projects to offset carbon emissions. Input your project details and emission data to calculate the forestification requirements for carbon neutrality.

Welcome to the Carbon Neutrality Forestification Project
How this application works:
Carbon Calculator: Input your carbon emissions and get an estimate of how much forest area you need to offset them.

ML Prediction: Use our machine learning model to estimate carbon sequestration potential based on various forest parameters.

About: Learn more about the methodology and assumptions behind our calculations.

Why Forestification?
Forests are natural carbon sinks that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and store it in biomass and soil. Strategic forestification can help neutralize carbon emissions while providing additional benefits like biodiversity conservation, soil protection, and water cycle regulation.# forestication
